## Testing the Application

The BankAPI application offers REST endpoints for creating, listing, updating, and deleting studants. You can use tools like [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/) to test the endpoints. Here are some `curl` command examples for testing the endpoints:

- **Create a studant:**

  ```
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "lucas travessa", "email": "lucas@lucas.com", "age": 12, "dob": "17/09/2002"}' http://localhost:8080/api/students
  ```

- **Update a studant:**

  ```
  curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Jo√£o Silva","email": "lucas@lucas.com"}' http://localhost:8080/api/students/{studantId}
  ```

- **Delete a studant:**

  ```
  curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/students/{studantID}
  ```

Remember to adjust the commands according to your needs and requirements.
